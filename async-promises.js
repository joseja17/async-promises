///////////////////Problem 2//////////////////

//Within the function lostCityFinder, create a promise and save

//promise should resolve with the value of the key 'name'.
//If the value of 'location' is not 'under the sea', the promise should reject with the 
//reason "Can't find Atlantis!"

function lostCityFinder(lostCity){
